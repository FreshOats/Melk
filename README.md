A study on water consumption with different types of plant based milk versus that of diary milk

In the Melk.xlsx file, I have several tabs that collected data acquired from numerous sources. 

Tab 1: Impact
    This initially held certain pieces of information collected in metric, whereas most of the subsequent information is in imperial units. Because most of the world uses metric and it is easier to interpret, I added several parameters to convert units to metric, and additional average costs collected in 2022 or 2023.

    - Product: Almond Milk, Dairy Milk, Oat Milk, and Soy Milk are the four products being compared. Other plant-based milks make up only a very small fraction of the market
    - Average Price per Gallon
    - Average Price per Liter (conversion)
    - Annual Sales in 2022 (total)
    - Volume Produced in Liters
    - Land Use (m^2 per kg)
    - Greenhouse Gas Emissions (kg of CO2 eq per Liter)
    - Freshwater Use (Liters of water per liter of milk produced)
    - Eutrophication (g PO4 eq per Liter of milk produced)
    - Tons produced dry (Metric tons of the original product, Almonds, Oats, Soybeans or dairy milk)
    - Pounds produced (the pounds of dairy milk produced)
    - Wet Density (lb/gal) the weight per gal of the milk
    - Dry density (lb/gal) the weight of non-water components of the milk - in the case of the plant milks, the weight of almonds/oats/soy added without water
    - Dry density (kg/L) converted from imperial to metric
    - Water Added (Gal/Gal or L/L) the ratio or percent of water that makes up each type of milk

Tabs 2-5: Almond, Dairy, Oats, Soy
    - Product (the dry product produced, NOT the plant-based milk)
    - Country 
    - Production (Tons - metric tons)
    - Production per Person (kg)
    - Acreage (Hectares) - how much land is used total
    - Yield (Kg/Hectare) - this tells us how efficient the country is at producing the product

Tab 6: Countries
    - Country
    - Continent - just identifies which continent each country is included in, in case of breakdown per continent

## What is the purpose of this? 

The initial proposed question leading to this investigation was whether Oat Milk is better for the environment than Almond Milk. There is a lot of evidence that supports that All plant-based milks are better for the environment with suppliments of the missing essential nutrients than dairy milk, or any animal-based milk products. 

However, almond milk is one of the most preferred types of plant-based milk, yet the regions where almonds grow are limited and prone to draught. 80% of the world's almonds are produced in California, according to claims online, and the state of California in the US is perpetually in a state of draught, and even drinking water is acquired from out-of-state in the USA's most populous state. While almonds are not only used for the production of Almond Milk, the constant rise of its popularity brings into question the sustainability of this market. 

One of the things that people like about Almond milk is the creamy texture and overall lack of flavor impact by the plant product, which is definitely present in Soy, Rice, and Coconut milks. Unsweetened Almond milk has a slightly nutty flavor, as does Cashew Milk, but these are very milk compared to the aforementioned plant milks. A more recent alternative rising in popularity has been oat milk, which also lacks in much flavor, but has creamier properties. 

If the intended purpose of the milk is to drink it directly, then the flavor will have a major impact on what the buyer is looking for. However, many people are looking for a dairy substitute for their coffee, cereal, tea, or cooking. It should be noted that in baking and cooking, certain dairy substitutes may lack the proteins present in milk that are utilized to get the proper chemistry of the product. For example pudding requires casein to react with the colloid carageenan to thicken the pudding. Without casein, you end up with a soupy delicious liquid instead of the expected texture if you use plant-based milks. 

But if your purpose is to switch out the product you use to add to a bowl of cereal, coffee, tea, or even top off a White Russian, the creaminess and lack of flavor is typically more important than the source. While I can attest that coconut milk in Cocoa Pebbles is delicious, not everyone appreciates the extra flavor, and coconuts have environmental impact issues of their own!

Note: As of 2022, Almond cultivation uses about 13% of the state's total water in California, and 17% of agricultural use in CA. Almonds grow in the Central Valley, which is hot, dry and prone to droughts. Agriculture in CA uses 80% of the CA developed water supply, but it only contributes to 2% of the CA economy. 

## Topics I want to look into:

1. A comparison of the markets and demands for the different types of milk products and on the same dashboard the environmental impacts of each of these
2. Climates of producing regions and countries where each product is produced
